Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,

I'm Joe, the founder of RailsDevs - the reverse job board for Ruby on Rails developers. Welcome!

The platform is a bit different than traditional job boards. Instead of posting a job description, you browse developer profiles to find a perfect match: <%= developers_url %>

When you see a good fit, click the Hire button. Your message goes right to their email inbox.

This approach has a ~60% response rate and can dramatically shorten the hiring process. I've seen offers made in as little as 2 weeks.

What are you looking for in your next hire? I'll send over some folks who could be a good fit.
