Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,

It’s Joe again, the founder of RailsDevs. Your subscription is live and you can message all <%= @developer_count %>+ Rails developers on the platform.

Get started by adding a filter or two when browsing developer profiles. Start with role level and work preference then try adding a specific term or technology:  <%= developers_url %>

When you see a good fit click the Hire button. Your message goes right to their email inbox.

Hit reply or schedule a call if you’d like help narrowing down your search: https://savvycal.com/joemasilotti/RailsDevs 

And thank you for your support in my bootstrapped, independent business.

P.S. Where did you first hear about RailsDevs?
