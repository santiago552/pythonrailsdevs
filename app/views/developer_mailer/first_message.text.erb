Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,

I'm Joe, the founder of RailsDevs. Congratulations on your first message today!

Here are some tips to make the most of conversations on RailsDevs:

1. Respond to every business, even to let them know you're not interested.
2. Don't be afraid to ask for salary or rate early in the process.
3. Start by letting them know why you are a great fit for the role.

Keep communication on RailsDevs. It helps me act if anyone is abusing the system.

And let me know when you land a gig and I'll send you some SWAG!
